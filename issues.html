                <p class="short-description">Lower Manhattan's dense traffic--especially near the Financial District--results in constant emissions from cars, delivery vans, and buses...</p> <!-- Preview text -->

                    <p>These vehicles release a mix of harmful pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. Prolonged exposure has been linked to increased rates of asthma, cardiovascular disease, and reduced lung development in children. Because of the high concentration of commuters and delivery vehicles, residents and workers are exposed to these pollutants daily-often without realizing the long-term health impact. The constant idling, narrow streets, and urban canyon effect all contribute to the poor air circulation that allows these emissions to linger in the neighborhood’s air.</p>

                <h2>Less Greenery</h2>
                <p class="short-description">Lower Manhattan has fewer parks and green zones than other NYC neighborhoods...</p>

                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>This lack of greenery means there are fewer natural barriers to trap airborne pollutants or cool the surrounding environment. Trees and vegetation play a key role in filtering out harmful substances like ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter from the air. In neighborhoods with low green coverage, residents often experience higher pollution levels, hotter summer temperatures, and fewer spaces to escape urban stress. The dense built environment in Lower Manhattan also intensifies the urban heat island effect, where concrete and asphalt absorb and re-radiate heat, making the air even more stagnant and polluted. Without an adequate buffer of natural spaces, the community is left more vulnerable to the health effects of poor air quality.</p>

                <h2>Construction Site Pollution</h2>
                <p class="short-description">Ongoing development projects release dust, diesel fumes, and fine particles into the air, especially during demolition and excavation...</p>

                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>Construction sites are a major, often overlooked, source of localized air pollution. Activities like jackhammering, concrete mixing, and material transportation release coarse dust particles (PM10) into the air, while heavy equipment powered by diesel engines emits smaller, more harmful pollutants like PM2.5 and black carbon. These particles can trigger respiratory irritation in the short term and contribute to chronic diseases with long-term exposure. People living or working near active construction zones often experience symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and headaches—especially when windows are left open. Even once the work ends, residual dust and debris can remain in the air or accumulate on surfaces, continuing to affect indoor and outdoor air quality.</p>

                <h2>Climate Change & Urban Heat</h2>
                <p class="short-description">The heat-island effect traps pollution over Lower Manhattan, especially in the summer...</p>

                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>Urban heat islands occur when buildings, pavement, and infrastructure absorb and retain heat, raising local temperatures significantly compared to nearby areas with more greenery. This increase in heat doesn’t just affect comfort—it worsens air quality by intensifying ground-level ozone and preventing pollutants from dispersing. The result is an environment where smog lingers longer and heat-sensitive individuals, like children and the elderly, are at greater risk for illness. In Lower Manhattan, the combined stress of heat and air pollution amplifies respiratory issues, strains public health systems, and reduces overall livability, especially during extreme weather events that are growing more frequent due to climate change.</p>
